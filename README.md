# Personal Project
My first independent Java project 

I created a scheduler with very basic functions

The scheduler comes with a GUI and some very interactions

I use this project as a way to learn basic coding principles, such as the observer pattern, the composite pattern, the singleton pattern, and more.

The software theory I studied include:
  the benefits of abstraction
  the use of exceptions
  the theory of cohesion and coupling
